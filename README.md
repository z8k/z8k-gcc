GCC backend for Zilog Z8000 processor

This is a backend for <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>
targeting the Zilog Z8000 microprocessor.

This code was written by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions">Cygnus
Solutions</a>, and dates from approximately 1995-1998. It can
still be downloaded from <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org">
sourceware.org</a>, packaged together with contemporaneous versions
of GCC and other GNU tools.

Find it here: 
ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/releases/ecos-1.2.1/ecosSWtools-990319.tar.bz2 

A lightly modified version of the same backend can be found
<a href="http://www.z80ne.com/m20/index.php?argument=sections/download/z8kgcc/z8kgcc.inc">
here</a>, packaged together with the same ancient version (2.9)
of GCC. This version of GCC will not compile with modern GNU tools.
